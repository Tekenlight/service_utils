Unfortunately, POP3 does **not** support advanced searching features, such as searching for emails since a specific date. POP3 is a simple protocol designed primarily for retrieving emails from a server to a local client. It lacks the capability to search emails directly on the server based on criteria like date, sender, or subject.

### Why POP3 Cannot Search by Date:
- **POP3 Protocol**: The POP3 protocol does not include any commands for searching emails based on metadata (like date, sender, or subject). It is primarily used for downloading and deleting messages from the server.
- **Limited Commands**: POP3 commands (`LIST`, `RETR`, `DELE`, etc.) only deal with listing, retrieving, and deleting emails. There are no provisions for querying the server based on date or other attributes.

### How to Work Around POP3's Limitations

Since there are no native POP3 commands for searching, the only way to achieve this is by downloading the message headers and filtering them manually on the client side. This involves:
1. **Listing the emails**: Use `LIST` to find out how many emails exist.
2. **Retrieving email headers**: Use the `TOP` command to fetch the headers (including the `Date` field).
3. **Parsing the `Date` field**: Check each email's `Date` header and compare it to the target date.
4. **Retrieving relevant emails**: Once the date is verified, retrieve the full message using `RETR`.

### Example Workflow Using POP3

Hereâ€™s how you would search for emails since a particular date using POP3 commands:

#### 1. **List all emails**:
Use the `LIST` command to get the number of messages in the inbox.

```bash
LIST
```

Example response:
```
+OK 3 messages (3200 octets)
1 1200
2 1000
3 1000
```

This shows that there are 3 messages in the inbox.

#### 2. **Retrieve email headers**:
Use the `TOP` command to retrieve just the headers of each email. The `TOP` command retrieves a specified number of lines from the top of the message, but by specifying `0` as the number of lines, you can retrieve only the headers.

To fetch the headers for message 1:
```bash
TOP 1 0
```

Example response (headers of the first email):
```
+OK
Date: Wed, 02 Oct 2024 14:37:00 +0000
From: sender@example.com
To: user@example.com
Subject: Sample Email 1
```

Repeat this process for each email (i.e., `TOP 2 0`, `TOP 3 0`, etc.).

#### 3. **Parse and compare the `Date` field**:
Once you retrieve the `Date` field from the headers, parse and compare it with your target date programmatically.

For example, if you want to find all emails since `01 Oct 2024`, you would compare the `Date` field to that value. This comparison needs to be done by your email client.

#### 4. **Download relevant emails**:
If an email is found to be newer than the target date, use the `RETR` command to retrieve the full message.

For example, to retrieve the first message:
```bash
RETR 1
```

#### 5. **Delete unwanted messages (optional)**:
After processing emails, you can optionally delete any unwanted emails using the `DELE` command:
```bash
DELE 1
```

### Conclusion:
POP3 does **not** support server-side search capabilities like filtering emails by date. Instead, you will need to:
1. List the emails.
2. Retrieve their headers.
3. Parse the `Date` field and compare it against your target date.
4. Manually download the relevant emails.

For more advanced mail searching capabilities, you may want to consider switching to **IMAP** (Internet Message Access Protocol), which supports commands like `SEARCH SINCE <date>`. IMAP is more suited for server-side searches and complex mailbox management.
